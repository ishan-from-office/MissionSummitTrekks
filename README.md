# Description 
Mission Summit Treks is a comprehensive web application I developed for a leading tour and travel agency in Nepal. The platform allows users to seamlessly explore a wide range of curated travel packages, book trips, and engage with the community through reviews and comments.

Leveraging my expertise in full-stack development, I built this application to provide a highly interactive and user-friendly experience. It includes key features such as secure booking, embedded YouTube videos and photo galleries for each destination, and a dynamic blog showcasing the natural beauty and cultural heritage of Nepal.

## Features in this web application
* Travel Packages: Browse and book from a selection of curated travel packages, ranging from cultural tours to trekking adventures in the Himalayas.
* Embedded Media: Each travel package includes embedded YouTube videos and photo galleries, giving users a visual preview of the destinations.
* User Reviews: Share reviews and comments on travel experiences, helping others make informed decisions.
* Blog Section: Read posts from the agency about Nepal's natural beauty, cultural heritage, and travel tips.
* Secure Booking: Users can book packages with ease, ensuring a smooth and safe transaction process.
* Admin Panel: Agency staff can manage travel packages, monitor bookings, and publish blog posts.
## This Project demonstrates my profiency in:
* Frontend: Creating responsive, engaging UIs from the UI/UX design
* Media Handeling: Embeding different media files and youtube videos.
* Data Fetching: Fetching data from API using axios
* State management: Enabling state management with redux.
