# Description 
Mission Summit Treks is a comprehensive web app I developed for a well-known travel agency called "Mission Summit Trekks" in Nepal. This is currently a live web application. This platform allows users to easily explore a wide range of carefully selected travel packages, book trips, and engage with the community through reviews and comments.

Using my frontend development skills, I worked on this application to provide a fun and user-friendly experience. It includes important features like secure booking, embedded YouTube videos, and photo galleries for every destination, plus a lively blog that showcases the breathtaking scenery and rich culture of Nepal.

## Features in this web application
* Travel Packages: Browse and book from a selection of curated travel packages, ranging from cultural tours to trekking adventures in the Himalayas.
*  Review and Comment: Travellers can also post comment on the package they visited and write a review on it.
* Embedded Media: Each travel package includes embedded YouTube videos and photo galleries, giving users a visual preview of the destinations.
* User Reviews: Share reviews and comments on travel experiences, helping others make informed decisions.
* Blog Section: Read posts from the agency about Nepal's natural beauty, cultural heritage, and travel tips.
* Secure Booking: Users can book packages with ease, ensuring a smooth and safe transaction process.
* Admin Panel: Agency staff can manage travel packages, monitor bookings, and publish blog posts.

## This Project demonstrates my profiency in:
* Frontend: Creating responsive, engaging UIs from the UI/UX design
* Media Handeling: Embeding different media files and youtube videos.
* Data Fetching: Fetching data from API using axios
* State management: Enabling state management with redux.
